List of things to do:

- Write DbManager test to check if deleting User deletes Source and SensorData
- Write DbManager test to check if deleting Source deletes SensorData
- Use JAXB plugin to get real equals() and hashCode()
- Normalize all JAXB code to use a centralized Property/Properties class
- Merge the Utility class code into the appropriate JAXB class, and refactor all the calls
- Resolve persistent errors in Eclipse wrt Ant build files
  - Maybe need to run Eclipse under Java 1.6 (requires downloading 64bit Eclipse version?)
  - Maybe need to install JAXB via Ivy (though it's a manual download, bletch)
  - Maybe need to add JAXB as library in Eclipse
- Add more tests for UsersResource once UserResource is fully implemented
- Add hashCode and equals to User (and downstream stuff), with unit tests
- Make UserIndex method in MemoryStorageImplementation sort the list before returning
- Make tests to confirm SensorDataIndexes and SourceIndexes returned are sorted in DbManagerSensorData
- Write a subclass of Guard that looks at the URI and authentication credentials and determines
whether to allow access, rather than doing it inside each resource. Resources will have to make
some decisions (like only putting public Sources in an index if the client is anonymous), but that
can be based off of a status field (ANON, ADMIN, OWNER).
- Put an end to the resource URI vs. name madness. Either use URIs everywhere, or use names
everywhere and convert to URIs only for output? 
- A public virtual source can point to private sources (including ones they don't own!), and
thereby make the private source data public. This is bogus. Public virtual sources should only be
allowed to point at public sources, and private virtual sources should only be allowed to point at
public sources and private sources _that they own_.
- Remove all traces of hard-coded default data in DbManager, and replace any uses of the default
data in test cases with data created in the test class. 
- Rename the input clients "sensors"
